## Project purpose ##
The purpose of this project is to build the game engine in Java.  This scope of this project is to only build the engine and game logic, but not have it be tied to any delivery technology or user interface.

This will allow those who wish to use this engine to place it inside a J2EE container to serve over the web to an AJAX/Cometd/Flash/Flex web interface or put a local UI on it for use on the desktop or Java-enabled mobile device.

Other projects outside of this one will deal with actual deployment technologies.
